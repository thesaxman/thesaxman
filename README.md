# About me

- I study aerospace engineering and currently figuring out the github workflow.
- I mostly work in MATLAB and Python but I'm open to trying new languages.
- My special interests are in CFD 🌊 so I can hopefully contribute to similar projects.
- Feel free to talk to me about Jazz 🎷 or Jiu Jitsu 🥋🤼‍♂️!
